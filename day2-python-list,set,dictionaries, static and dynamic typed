python
=========

def nandu(): → defines a function named nandu

print("hello, nandu") → runs when the function is called

nandu() → calls the function

--------------------------------------------

1. def add_numbers(...)   → function definition
2. add_numbers(3,4)       → function call
3. total = 3 + 4
4. return 7
5. result = 7
6. print output



Function code runs ONLY when the function is called, not when it is defined.



def add_numbers(num1, num2):
Function name add_numbers is stored in memory

Function body is saved

❗ No execution yet



⭐ Important rules to remember

✔ Variables inside a function exist only during function execution
✔ After return, function memory is cleared
✔ Returned value is stored in the calling variable
✔ Python manages memory automatically (no manual delete)




List
=====
duplicates allowed
mutable 
append(last lo add aithadi)
extend([last lo extend cheyyi])
insert(index-place-lo, this value will insert)


tuple
========
immutable = tuples cant be modified once created
duplicates allowed bcz indexing undi


Methods like append(), remove(), pop(), etc., are not available.


SETS :
==========


    No Duplicate Elements:   Sets automatically remove duplicate elements.
    Unordered: Sets do not maintain the order of elements.
    Mutable: You can add or remove elements from a set.
	
    Use Cases: Sets are useful for removing duplicates from a collection, checking for membership, and performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
    


STATICALLY TYPED  VS DYNAMIC TYPED 
=======================================

x = 10

Dynamic typing means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime, not in advance. You do not need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. 


Static typing means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. You must declare the type of a variable before you use it, and this type cannot change throughout the program. Languages like C, C++, go  and Java are statically typed.
